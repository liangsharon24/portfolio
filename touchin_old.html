            <p>Alzheimer’s disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. By 2020, there will be 5.7 millions of elderly people in the U.S. with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
            <p>Given the growing number of people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, the health care of patients with Alzheimer’s disease becomes an important issue. These patients require long-term care. The intensive caregiving process increases the burden of these caregivers and impair the quality of life of both patients and their families.</p>

            <p>Our restricted understanding of the Alzheimer’s disease meant that we need to gain more insight directly from people with Alzheimer’s disease and their families. We did six -hour interviews with four caregivers and patients. Our interviews revealed many insights more than our primary understanding of Alzheimer’s disease:

            <p>We also found that the common strategies to cope with these challenges did not serve as an ideal solution:</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Short-term and remote assistance</h3>
            <p>Based on the previous finding, we aimed to proposed a solution that can lower caregivers’ burdens and increase patients’ social interaction at the same time.
              <br>
              We proposed an on-demand caregiver-sourcing: a platform that provides short-term and remote caregivers to patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

            <p> A subsequent issue would be what are the activities that is suitable for these remote caregivers to do during their companion with the patients. The activities I found during my exploration converged to three main categories:</p>
          </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="emphasis">The activity should be <span class="superemphasis">simple</span> enough without complicated planning steps, such as visiting a garden or watching a therapy dog.
              </p>
              </div>

              <div class="vline col-md-4">
              <p class="emphasis">
            The activity should have a certain degree of <span class="superemphasis">repetition or predictability</span>, such as interacting with a speaking toy that repeats what it receives.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p class="emphasis">
            The activity should still be <span class="superemphasis">creative and stimulating</span>, such as coloring or jigsaw.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-12">
            <p><br>
            Based on these findings, we refined our solution to be an interactive tablet with guided drawing app that can be connected to the short-term remote caregivers that will facilitate the coloring activities.</p>

              <div>
              <h3 class="text-center">Where to find the suitable caregiver?</h3>
              <p>There are myriad research that help us to find the suitable remote caregiver, such as using a rating system. However, we want to focus more on the interaction of our proposal, so we assumed to use the most adopted way to recruit remote caregivers.</p>
            </div>

              <div>
              <h3 class="text-center">Is coloring the best activities for people with Alzheimer’s disease?</h3>
              <p>Based on our previous research, a good activities for people with Alzheimer’s disease should be simple, predictable as well as stimulating. Coloring fulfilled these three criteria. We ran a two-hour observation in a day center for people with Dementia, and we found that coloring was a daily activity they had.</p>

            <p>We tested the first version of our prototype, and found that:</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Ultimating the Interaction Experience</h3>
                <p>Most of the challenges our participants faced were come from the unfamiliarity with the technology and a constant attention shift between the iPad screen and the laptop screen. Therefore, we moved the images of remote caregivers on the same screen where participants can draw on. We changed our design because we want to provide an experience close to face-to-face interaction.</p>

            <h3>Brainstorming the solution</h3>
            <p>After collecting data from the interviews, online forums and papers, we hold several brainstorming sessions to discuss the possible designs. The design solution was approached from different perspectives such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A financial app to help them manage the expense of life.</li>
              <li>Devices that help them exercise on a daily basis.</li>
              <li>Games that can maintain their attentions by interacting with them and give them suggestion when they are confused.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By presenting the proposals and collecting feedbacks, we decide to focus on:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Increasing the social interaction for people live alone in the house.</li>
              <li>A product that can maintain their attention for a period of time.</li>

                <p id="test1">The goal of this testing is to understand:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Whether Alzheimer’s patients can interact with people through a Skype video call.</li>

                <p>Five types of hints on a coloring task that indicated where to start was presented to the participants, and how they react with these hints were recorded.</p>
                <p id="concepttest1"> The goal is to understand:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Whether Alzheimer’s patients need other people help them to start a task, and help them decide which color they should use.</li>

              <li>Elder people need someone else to accompanied at first to help them be familiar with the technology.</li>
              <li>They would like to try the coloring game on ipad. However, if there were too many color choices or there were too many steps to do for changing a color, they felt confusing. </li>
              <li>Their need for assistance was especially strong when they are using an unfamiliar device.</li>
              <li>None of the hints we designed works for the patients. They knew it was a hint but would neglect the hint and use their own way to do the task.</li>

            <h3>Iteration 2: How to improve participants’ understanding about how the interface?</h3>
            <p>Approach: The moderator also holds an ipad with identical screen and demonstrates the steps to the participant through video call.</p>
            <p>Finding:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>The participant often got stuck at selecting a color because the interface did not provide clear feedback about which color was chosen.</li>
              <li>Participants showed a willingness to interact with people in the screen.</li>
              <li>It required an attention shift of the participants between the iPad screen and the laptop screen, which might be overloading to the participant.</li>

                <p>Approach: The video image was overlapping with the canvas. It not only decreases the devices required for the system but also provides an interaction that is closer to face-to-face interaction.</p>
                <p>We used the app, DrawTime, which provides similar function, to test our concept.</p>
                <p>Findings:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The participants still struggled with changing color by touching the color palette on the screen.</li>
                  <li>The participant felt confused about the instruction of moderators because the location of the camera resulted in an inconsistency of the hand position between where the moderator pointed to and where it was presented on the screen of the participant’s ipad.</li>
